    "- Text - str (text goes in what programmers call 'strings')\n",
    "- Numeric - int (integers are counting numbers)\n",
    "- Numeric - float (floating point numbers have a decimal and some amount of precision)\n",

    "### Numeric - complex\n",
    "The *complex* type is used to store complex numbers. A complex number take the form a + ib, where a is the real number and ib is the imaginary number. i is the square root of negative one, so we call it \"imaginary.\" One detail - engineers use the convention \"j\" instead of \"i\" for the square root of negative one, so Python follows the engineering convention. We won't be using these in this lab, but if you want to brush up on complex numbers, there's a [great intro at Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:complex/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:imaginary/a/intro-to-the-imaginary-numbers).\n",

    "### Sequences - list [] and tuple ()\n",
    "Lists and tuples (pronounced too-pulls) are used to store lists of things like \"1,2,3,4\" or \"dog,cat,horse,zebra\". The difference is that lists can be changed after you create them (they are *mutable*) and tuples cannot be changed (they are *immutable*). The code below initializes a list and a tuple and illustrates how Python also lets you figure out what type any variable is."
